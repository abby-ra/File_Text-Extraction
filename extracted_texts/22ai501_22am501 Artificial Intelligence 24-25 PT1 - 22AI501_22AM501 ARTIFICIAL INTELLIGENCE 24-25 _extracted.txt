change. Based on the above Scenario, answer the questions below.

cell(Goal node) - K ]

6. Question


--- Page 5 ---
Assertion (A): The uninformed search does not contain any domain knowledge such as closeness, the location of the
goal. It operates in a brute-force way as it only includes information about how to traverse the tree and how to identify
leaf and goal nodes.
Reason (R): As it applies in a way in which search tree is searched without any information about the search space
like initial state operators and test for the goal, so it is also called blind search. It examines each node of the tree until
it achieves the goal node.
Choose the correct option:
a) Both A and R are true and R is the correct explanation of A.
b) Both A and R are true but R is not the correct explanation of A.
c) A is false but R is true.
d) Both A and R are false.
Answer:
a) Both A and R are true and R is the correct explanation of A.
7. Question
Vidhya is going to build an AI agent for a city navigation system designed to find the shortest path between two
locations in a large metropolitan area. The city is represented as a graph, where intersections are nodes and roads are
edges with varying distances. The AI agent needs to efficiently navigate this graph to provide the shortest route
between any two given locations.
Based on the above Scenario, is Vidhya using the bidirectional search algorithm is used. If yes, means justify with
your answer.
Answer:
Yes.
Bidirectional search algorithm runs two simultaneous searches, one form initial state called as forward-search and
other from goal node called as backward-search, to find the goal node. Bidirectional search replaces one single search
graph with two small subgraphs in which one starts the search from an initial vertex and other starts from goal vertex.
The search stops when these two graphs intersect each other. Bidirectional search can use search techniques such as
BFS, DFS, DLS, etc.

17. Question
Let’s consider a simplified Sudoku puzzle to illustrate the problem-solving process step by step. It includes:
Variables: 9x9 grid cells
Domains: Numbers from 1 to 9
Constraints: No number can repeat in the same row, column, or 3x3 sub grid.
[Hint]: Step 1: Start with an empty Sudoku grid.
Based on the above condition, Complete the problem-solving steps for 9x9 Sudoku grid cells.
Step 2: _________________
Step 3: _________________
Step 4: _________________
Answer:
Step 2: Apply the initial constraints for the given numbers, reducing the domains of variables based on the puzzle’s
clues.
Step 3: Use constraint propagation to narrow down the domains further. For example, if a row has two cells with
domains {2, 5}, and the constraint specifies that these two cells cannot have the same number, we can eliminate the
possibility of 5 for one of them.
Step 4: Continue applying constraints and propagating until the domains of variables are either empty or filled with
single values. If they are all filled, you have a valid solution. If any variable’s domain is empty, you backtrack to the
previous step and try an alternative assignment.

20. Question
Kaviya is working on a scheduling system for a small conference. The system needs to assign time slots to different
sessions, taking into account the availability of the rooms, the preferences of the speakers, and potential conflicts
between sessions.
Say True or false:
Is back tracking being possible in the above scenario; If yes or No means justify with your answer.
Answer:
Yes,
Backtracking is possible. It is well-suited for this problem because it systematically explores possible assignments and
prunes those that violate constraints. It is particularly effective when:
Constraints are complex: Constraints like room availability, time slot conflicts, and speaker preferences can be
efficiently managed through backtracking.
Search Space is large: Backtracking helps in narrowing down the search space by eliminating infeasible
assignments early.
Solution is incremental: The problem allows for incremental assignment, where partial solutions can be extended
or retracted based on constraints.
By using backtracking, you ensure that you explore all possible valid schedules and find a solution that satisfies all
constraints. It balances between exploring potential solutions and avoiding invalid ones, making it a practical
approach for scheduling problems with multiple constraints.

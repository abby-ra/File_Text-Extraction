Using a slow image processor as `use_fast` is unset and a slow processor was saved with this 
model. `use_fast=True` will be the default behavior in v4.52, even if the model was saved 
with a slow processor. This will result in minor differences in outputs. You'll still be able 
to use a slow processor with `use_fast=False`.
Some weights of VisionEncoderDecoderModel were not initialized from the model checkpoint at 
microsoft/trocr-large-handwritten and are newly initialized: ['encoder.pooler.dense.bias', 
'encoder.pooler.dense.weight']
You should probably TRAIN this model on a down-stream task to be able to use it for 
predictions and inference.

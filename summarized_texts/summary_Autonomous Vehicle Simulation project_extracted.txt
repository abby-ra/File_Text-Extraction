The vehicle will be able to perform basic tasks, including: Lane detection and keeping the car in the lane. Polynomial fitting to smooth the detected lane boundaries and track the car’s position relative to the lane. Step 3: Path Planning and Control Path Planning Algorithms: You’ll need to create a system that takes input from the lane detection, traffic sign recognition, and other sensors to make driving decisions. For path planning, simple algorithms like A* (A-star) or Dijkstra’s algorithm can be used to plan the best route, but for real-time driving, a more advanced approach like Model Predictive Control (MPC) can be used. Simple control algorithms like PID (Proportional-Integral-Derivative) control can be used to adjust the car's speed and steering angle to follow the lane or navigate through the environment. Step 4: Reinforcement Learning (Optional) For a more advanced project, you can explore reinforcement learning (RL) to enable the car to learn how to drive by interacting with the environment. For example: Q-learning or Deep Q-Networks (DQN) could be used to train the car to drive by rewarding it for staying in the lane, avoiding collisions, and following traffic rules. Many simulation platforms (like CARLA or Gazebo) handle vehicle dynamics for you, but it’s important to understand how vehicle kinematics (like steering angles, velocity, and position) work in the context of control systems. Evaluate the overall system by measuring the car’s ability to stay in the lane, avoid obstacles, and obey traffic signs. This step is more advanced and may require additional hardware and software integration, but the focus in a simulation environment is on proving the algorithms and systems work reliably.

The algorithm's execution time or space requirement remains constant regardless of the size of the input. Example: accessing an element in an array by with the size of the input. O(n): Linear time complexity. The algorithm's performance grows linearly with the size of the O(n log n): Log-linear time complexity. The algorithm's performance grows quadratically with the the size of the input. Example: brute-force search algorithms. The algorithm's performance grows factorially with the size

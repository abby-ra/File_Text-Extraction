Question\nSakthi was an AI developer who was developing an AI agent to participate in a treasure hunt within a complex maze.\nThe maze is a grid of cells, some of which are blocked (walls), and some contain treasures. The agent starts at a given\nposition and needs to find the shortest path to a treasure. The environment is static, meaning the maze layout does not\nchange. Based on the above Scenario, answer the questions below.\n[Hint: cells —à node ,walls —à arrows , treasures —à cost of the node ; Starting cell(node) – A and Ending/Goal\ncell(Goal node) - K ]\n\n\n[Page 4]\nFigure: Treasure hunt(Searching Problem)\nConsider the above Figure: Treasure hunt(Searching Problem), and Predict the output for\na) Breadth-first Search (Goal node E) [Hint]: A---->B---->C\nb) Depth-first Search (Goal node E) [Hint]: A---->B---->D\nc) Depth-limited Search (Goal node G) [Hint]: A---->B---->D\nd) Iterative deepening depth-first search (Goal node E) [Hint]: A---->B---->C\ne) Uniform cost search (Goal node K) [Hint]: A---->B---->C\nAnswer:\na) A-B-C-D-E\nb) A-B-D-H-I-E\nc) A-B-D-E-C-F-G\nd) A-B-C-D-E or A-B-D-E\ne) A-B-C-D-E or A-B-D-E\n6. Question\n\n\n[Page 5]\nAssertion (A): The uninformed search does not contain any domain knowledge such as closeness, the location of the\ngoal. It operates in a brute-force way as it only includes information about how to traverse the tree and how to identify\nleaf and goal nodes.\nReason (R): As it applies in a way in which search tree is searched without any information about the search space\nlike initial state operators and test for the goal, so it is also called blind search. It examines each node of the tree until\nit achieves the goal node.\nChoose the correct option:\na) Both A and R are true and R is the correct explanation of A.\nb) Both A and R are true but R is not the correct explanation of A.\nc) A is false but R is true.\nd) Both A and R are false.\nAnswer:\na) Both A and R are true and R is the correct explanation of A.\n7. Question\nVidhya is going to build an AI agent for a city navigation system designed to find the shortest path between two\nlocations in a large metropolitan area. The city is represented as a graph, where intersections are nodes and roads are\nedges with varying distances. The AI agent needs to efficiently navigate this graph to provide the shortest route\nbetween any two given locations.\nBased on the above Scenario, is Vidhya using the bidirectional search algorithm is used. If yes, means justify with\nyour answer.\nAnswer:\nYes.\nBidirectional search algorithm runs two simultaneous searches, one form initial state called as forward-search and\nother from goal node called as backward-search, to find the goal node. Bidirectional search replaces one single search\ngraph with two small subgraphs in which one starts the search from an initial vertex and other starts from goal vertex.\nThe search stops when these two graphs intersect each other. Bidirectional search can use search techniques such as\nBFS, DFS, DLS, etc.\n8.

Question\nLet’s consider a simplified Sudoku puzzle to illustrate the problem-solving process step by step. It includes:\nVariables: 9x9 grid cells\nDomains: Numbers from 1 to 9\nConstraints: No number can repeat in the same row, column, or 3x3 sub grid.\n[Hint]: Step 1: Start with an empty Sudoku grid.\nBased on the above condition, Complete the problem-solving steps for 9x9 Sudoku grid cells.\nStep 2: _________________\nStep 3: _________________\nStep 4: _________________\nAnswer:\nStep 2: Apply the initial constraints for the given numbers, reducing the domains of variables based on the puzzle’s\nclues.\nStep 3: Use constraint propagation to narrow down the domains further. For example, if a row has two cells with\ndomains {2, 5}, and the constraint specifies that these two cells cannot have the same number, we can eliminate the\npossibility of 5 for one of them.\nStep 4: Continue applying constraints and propagating until the domains of variables are either empty or filled with\nsingle values. If they are all filled, you have a valid solution. If any variable’s domain is empty, you backtrack to the\nprevious step and try an alternative assignment.\n18.

Question\nKaviya is working on a scheduling system for a small conference. The system needs to assign time slots to different\nsessions, taking into account the availability of the rooms, the preferences of the speakers, and potential conflicts\nbetween sessions.\nSay True or false:\nIs back tracking being possible in the above scenario; If yes or No means justify with your answer.\nAnswer:\nYes,\nBacktracking is possible. It is well-suited for this problem because it systematically explores possible assignments and\nprunes those that violate constraints. It is particularly effective when:\nConstraints are complex: Constraints like room availability, time slot conflicts, and speaker preferences can be\nefficiently managed through backtracking.\nSearch Space is large: Backtracking helps in narrowing down the search space by eliminating infeasible\nassignments early.\nSolution is incremental: The problem allows for incremental assignment, where partial solutions can be extended\nor retracted based on constraints.\nBy using backtracking, you ensure that you explore all possible valid schedules and find a solution that satisfies all\nconstraints. It balances between exploring potential solutions and avoiding invalid ones, making it a practical\napproach for scheduling problems with multiple constraints.\n21.
